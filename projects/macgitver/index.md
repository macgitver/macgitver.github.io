# About the MacGitver project
More experienced users of the Git version control system know, that it is a very powerful and useful system. But -- the learning curve is still high for newcomers. And even experienced users always have to lookup command options to accomplish more complex versioning tasks.

The lack of a good user interface (at least) for all major plattforms makes the user experience even worse.

## Let's fix that!
MacGitver makes Git easier for newcomers and takes some of the burden, having to learn hundreds of Git options, hacking them into a terminal to simply setup a working repository.
At the same time, professional users are able to accomplish more sophisticated tasks like when a team member accidently messed up a repository.

## Some internal details and project history
Development of MacGitver started in 2011 and actually is actually the result of two separate projects, driven by the same motivation:
*Create a freely available user interface to control Git in a comfortable way.*

The developers of both projects decided to merge their begun work into one of the two projects. Thus, the other project, called *MsPiggit*, is no longer maintained and only lies there for reference.

To make the system perform fast and support at least the major desktop plattforms as good as possible, Qt and C/C++ were the first choice as a solid base.

## So, what is it?
Well, in short, the goal is to make you feel like being at home, relaxing on the couch, while managing complex versioning tasks of a your project(s) at work.
